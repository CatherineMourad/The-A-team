# The-A-team
We are Ain shams university senior students , mechatronics department and that's our digital image processing project using opencv and python 
This application allows you to try and choose your favorite glasses design ,color and shape 
It recognizes your face and your eyes through haar cascade algorithm through the laptop live camera or a chosen photo 
choose your favorite glasses design and then try it
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method , It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

Here we will work with face and eye detection. Then we need to extract features from it. After recognizing the frontal face and eyes , glasses filters are applied using opencv python. Finally we made a GUI using a built-in module named TKINTER

Users may need to download packages as : -opencv python 
                                         -utils packages
                                         -tkinter package 

there are two methods of interfacing , through opening the live video camera or choosing the photo
